# Report of the second assignment
## Technical problems
1. I was getting an error trying to visualize the database in IntelliJ and other programs, but then I realised that the version of h2 Driver was causing the error, so I looked in pom.xml and I downloaded the driver to make it work.

## How I inspected the database
I used IntelliJ Databases Tools and DBeaver.

The tables created are:
- One for each class (5)
- One for each many-to-many relations (2)

## Pending issues
I think there are no pending issues.
